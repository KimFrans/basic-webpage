        I want to learn the language French because it's a romance language, but thats not the only reason. The French language is an offical language in 29 countries across multiple continents! French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
