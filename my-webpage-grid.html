             I want to learn the language French because it's a romance language, but thats not the only reason. The French language is an offical language in 29 countries across multiple continents! French has a long history as an international language of literature and scientific standards and is a primary or second language of many international organisations including the United Nations, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Olympic Committee, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

        <p>
          District Six Museum is a museum in the former inner-city residential area and, District Six, in Cape Town, South Africa in an old Methodist church.
          District Six Foundation was founded in 1989 and the museum in 1994, as a memorial to the forced movement of 60,000 inhabitants of various races in District Six during Apartheid in South Africa in the 1970s.
          The floor of the museum is covered with a big map of the district with hand written notes of former inhabitants, which indicate where their houses were located.

        <h2>Castle of GoodHope</h2>
        <p> 
          The Castle of Good Hope (Dutch: Kasteel de Goede Hoop; Afrikaans: Kasteel die Goeie Hoop) known locally as the Castle or Cape Town Castle is a bastion fort built in the 17th century in Cape Town, South Africa. 
          Originally located on the coastline of Table Bay, following land reclamation the fort is now located inland.
          Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest existing building in South Africa.

          The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott.
          The tower of the City Hall has a Turret Clock which strikes the hours and chimes the Westminster quarters.
          On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall.
